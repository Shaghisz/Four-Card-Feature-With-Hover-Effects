## Overview

This is actually a really good exercise for beginners that are new to 2D flex and grid systems(column and Row together).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

 I actually added some animations on the code so that it looks more interactive, attractive and
 beautiful.
  And I think i'm getting better on that and it is so much fun just playing with it ,
  "I can do this all Day":(Captain America).

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
 animation: hi 3s linear forwards;
}
```

### Continued development

  I would like to have more challenges like this and even more on JavaScript ,
  css animations , css scroll animations. THANK YOU!
